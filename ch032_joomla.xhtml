<p>Embedding a phpList subscribe form within a Joomla web site is pretty straightforward.
  <br/><br/>Once you have created your own subscriber form in phpList log on to your Joomla admin pages and create a new Menu item. In my example, I called the menu item News Subscribe.
</p>
<p>Then choose the Wrapper&gt;iframe Wrapper option for the Menu Item Type:
</p>
<p><img src="/phplist/_edit/static/wrapper.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Checking back to my phpList installation, I viewed the Config&gt;Subscribe Pages and viewed the custom page I had designed earlier. Taking the actual URL, the bit that ends in "/?p=subscribe&amp;id=1" where the &amp;id= your subscribe page, pasted that entire URL into the Joomla News Subscribe Basic Options&gt; URL box.
  <br/></p>
<p><img src="static/url.jpg" alt=""/><br/></p>
<p>&#160;
</p>
<p>Next I set the Scroll Bar parameters to be wide enough to fit the Subscribe Page within the confines of the Joomla Main Content and the height was sufficient to fit the entire subscribe page within the iframe. This also ensured that the confirmation page was automatically contained in the Joomla iframe.
</p>
<p>
  <br/><img src="/phplist/_edit/static/scroll.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>And the result can be seen here:
</p>
<p>&#160;<img src="static/result.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>You may notice that the above subscription page includes Captcha anti-bot protection. This is available as a phpList Plug-in, freely available from the <a href="http://resources.phplist.com/plugins/start" target="_blank" alt="phpList Plugins" title="phpList Plugins">phpList plugins pages</a>.To install and set up this or any other phpList plug-in, follow the instructions on the relevant plug-in page.
  <br/></p>

  <br/><strong>Integrating phpList into Joomla!</strong>
  <br/><br/>The idea of integrating as against embedding phpList into a Joomla website is that when embedding you are using the phpList subscribe form from an external phpList installation. When integrating you plan on allowing people to sign up to your Joomla installation and automatically adding their details to your phpList campaigns. All of the phpList-Joomla bridges are commercial third party offerings so you cannot try them out to see which would work best for you, sort of defeating the Open Source principle of both Joomla and phpList. <strong>Please note:</strong> <em>The Joomla plugins currrently available are for version 2.10.x and will not work with the current version 3.0.x of phpList.</em> As such this is outside the scope of this manual. Check the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/search?q=phplist" alt="Joomla Extensions" title="Joomla Extenions - phpList bridges (Commercial)" target="_blank">Joomla Extension Directory</a>.
