</h1>
<h2>Possible Errors
</h2>
<h2>Error 500:
  <br/></h2>
<p>The .htaccess file must be present in the lists/ directory and must contain the line"DirectoryIndex index.php" this ensures phpList looks for index.php rather then the default index.htm(l).
</p>
<p>Also. because this file tries to be all things to all servers, if you get a Error 500 report when first running phpList the issue could be that there are any lines that start "php_value " they have a better than 50:50 chance of crashing your installation with the dreaded Error 500. In this case, either remove the lines completely, or add a hash "#" to the start of any lines beginning with php_value (so it would look like this&#160; #php_value) and resave the .htaccess file.
</p>
<h2> mySQLi error:
  <br/></h2>
<p>If you receive an error referring to mySQL or mySQLi then you need to change this line "$database_module = "mysql.inc";" to this "$database_module = "mysqli.inc";" the line in question is around 700-710 of the full config.php file
  <br/></p>
<p>From version 5.5 of <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>, the mysql_ functions have been deprecated.
