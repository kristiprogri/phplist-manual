</p>
<p>You can then choose to make a plain text version of your campaign. Some of your users may opt to receive this version rather than the fancy html version which you composed in the first tab. It good practice to provide a plain text version because it displays better in some email software. You can manually compose version, or you can generate it automatically by using the <strong>generate from HTML button.</strong>

</p>
<p>Any images will disappear and be replaced by text descriptions. You cannot send images in a TEXT version remember.&#160; You can also edit the message further if required. Once you are happy with your plain text version, click <strong>Next</strong> again. Then it is time to test your campaign.
</p>
<h2>Test your campaign
  <br/></h2>
<p>To do this you must enter your email into the <strong>Send text</strong> box. You can send multiple test emails by separating the addresses with a comma - it is a good idea to test in both webmail and a client such as Thunderbird. All the emails you send a test to must already be on one of your lists: if they are not, you will be prompted to add them.
</p>
<p>Once you have entered the email, click <strong>Send test</strong>.
  <br/></p>

<p>Check that the
</p>
<ul><li>formatting is displaying as expected</li>
  <li>your links go to the right places
  <br/></li>
  <li>you have not made any spelling errors.
  <br/></li>
</ul><p>It is easy to skip this step because sending the mail is so exciting, but it is <em>really</em> important to check... and after all, it only takes a few minutes.
</p>
<p>Once happy with your text part of your Campaign, click on Next.
