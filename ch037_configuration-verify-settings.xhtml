</h1>
<p>The configuration process starts when, after installation, you see this screen:
</p>
<p><img src="static/configuration.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>This chapter deals only with the <strong>Verify Settings</strong> instruction, because attributes, lists, subscribe pages and subscribers are dealt with in other chapters.
</p>
<p>The <strong>Settings</strong> page discussed in this chapter is normally accessed through <strong>Config </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>there are lots of settings for you to change at any-time, however, it's good to take an overview after install.
</p>
<p>To start your settings verification click <strong>Go there</strong> next to Verify settings in your configuration overview, or navigate to <strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>settings</strong> from the main menu.
  <br/></p>
<h2>General Settings
</h2>
<p>These settings will have been completed for you during installation. This example is taken from a personal website/blog.

<h2>Security settings
</h2>
<h3>Checking for new versions:
</h3>
<p> It is important that you keep your installation secure: this means keeping it up-to-date. This setting, defaulting to 7 days, is how often your phpList will check for updates. When you are notified of a new version, you should update as soon as you can.
</p>

</p>
<h2>Reporting settings
</h2>
<p>These settings establish who will be notified, by email, of occurrences in your phpList install. These include <strong>system messages</strong>, such as notices of new subscribers, or <strong>reports</strong> such as when your campaign sending starts and finishes.
</p>
<p><img src="static/phpList_config_reporting_settings.png" alt=""/><br/></p>
<p>It may be that you have a team of people or an individual, standard emails emails, like <a href="mailto:name@mydomain.com">name@mydomain.com</a>, or specific secondary accounts. like phpList_admin@mydoimain.com.
</p>
<p>You can change these settings any time, but it's good to keep these emails in the same place so take some time to decide how you want to manage your system now.

</p>
<h2>Campaign settings
</h2>
<p>
  <br/>This section specifies many of the defaults for your campaigns, for example, which email to display in the from line of your email.
</p>
<p><img src="static/phpList_config_campaign_settings_2.png" alt=""/>&#160;
</p>
<p>While you can change some of these options during the composition of an individual campaign, they will always display as stated here during the next campaign. If you will usually be using the same settings, it is simpler and safer to specify them correctly here so you don't need to remember to add/edit these details every time you send a new campaign.
</p>
<p>The settings regards html template and the default footer are dealt with in the chapters about templates.&#160;
</p>
<h2>Transnational settings
</h2>
<p>These are the settings for the automatic emails that get sent by phpList to your subscribers when they preform an action. For example, when they subscribe or change their details. The emails in this section are usually noreply@mydomain.com.
</p>
<p><img src="static/phpList_config_transactional_settings.png" alt=""/>&#160;
</p>
<p>This is because it is common for subscribers to reply to these emails, for example asking to be unsubscribed, rather than use the automated processes provided by phpList, which can unsubscribe without any additional work by the list manager.
  <br/></p>
<p>In addition to specifying the email addresses to be used for transactional messages, this section also deals with the content of these emails. These are ready-made for you, however, you may wish to customize them to reflect your circumstances or brand identity. If you do this, make sure not to remove any of the information included in the default messages.

</p>
<h2>Segmentation settings
  <br/></h2>
<p>This section allows you to edit your list category organization. This is dealt with in the chapter about categories.
</p>
<h2>Subscription settings
  <br/></h2>
<p> This section provides you with the links to various functional pages within your phpList install. Most of the time you should not edit these settings. They provide a useful reference.
</p>
<h2>Composition settings
</h2>
<p>This area changes depending on which plugins you are using, and has some useful tweaks for your WYSIWYG editor. For example you can specify the width of the editor. This might be useful if you plan to compose your campaigns on a tablet computer or smart phone.
</p>
