</h1>
<p>The first thing you do to use phpList is log in. This chapter assumes that you already have an installation and that you have a user name and password.

<h2>phpList when you are logged out
</h2>
<p>When you are not logged in, any page you visit in your phpList installation will prompt you to enter your username and password. For example, if I visit my dashboard, which usually resides at my-domain.com/lists/admin:
  <br/></p>
<p><img src="static/logging_in_url_phpList.png" alt="logged out of phpList" height="245" width="685"/></p>
<p>I would see my login prompt, marked below in red.

</p>
<p>When you have successfully entered your username and password you will see the page you were trying to access. In this case, the <strong>Dashboard</strong>.

<p>It is a good idea to bookmark your dashboard and use it as the primary way to access your phpList. Depending on your configuration, your dashboard might look a little different, for example there might be more items on your menu bar.

<h2>How to log out of phpList
</h2>
<p>The <strong>Logout</strong> button will always display in the top right of your installation.
</p>
<p><em>Remember to logout when you are not using phpList: your installation contains the personal data of your subscribers and it is your responsibility to keep it secure.
  <br/></em>
