</h1>
<p>Your phpList can be extended, adapted and customized by the use of plugins.
</p>
<p>You can:
</p>
<ul><li>Use plugins from the <a href="https://resources.phplist.com/plugins/start">phpList plugin library</a>, which are developed by the phpList community,</li>
  <li>Develop your own plugin, or pay a developer to build it for you.</li>
  <li>Contribute your plugin back into the plugin library.
  <br/></li>
</ul><p>This chapter will show you how to install, enable/disable and delete a plugin.
</p>
<p>In the example used, we will change the choice of editor used in our install by installing the <span class="listingname">CKEditorPlugin and disabling the </span><span class="listingname"><span class="listingname">fckphplist </span>plugin, </span>
</p>
<h2>The plugins page
</h2>
<p>To get to the plugins page from the main menu, click<strong> Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage plugins</strong>.
  <br/></p>
<p><span class="listingname"><img src="static/plugins_menu_phpList.png" alt=""/></span>
</p><span class="listingname">
<p>You will then see a list of the plugins you currently have installed. To find new plugins click the <strong>Find plugins </strong>link.
</p>
<p><img src="static/plugins_link.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>the plugin library will then open in a new page.
</p></span>
<h2>Getting the plugin URL from the plugin library <span class="listingname"/>
</h2>
<p> Once you have clicked the <strong>Find plugins</strong> link, you will see the plugin library. Scroll down or search to find the desired plugin.
</p>
<p> In this example we are installing the <span class="listingname">CKEditorPlugin.</span>
</p>
<p>Right click on the <strong>Download</strong> link and choose the option to copy the url. The wording of this option will depend on your browse: in this case it read <strong>Copy Link Location</strong>.
  <br/></p>
<p><img src="static/copy_url.png" alt=""/><br/></p>
<h2><span class="listingname"/>Installing the plugin
</h2>
<p>Return to your phpList (it should be in the browser tab to the left of the plugin library). Paste the url into the box labelled <strong>Plugin package URL</strong> and click the <strong>Install plugin</strong> below.
  <br/></p>
<p><img src="static/click_install.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>You will see that the plugin installed. Click <strong>Continue.</strong>
</p>
<p><img src="static/click_continue.png" alt=""/>&#160;
</p>
<h2>Turning plugins on and off
</h2>
<p>Once you are on the plugins page, either from <strong>Config </strong>&gt; <strong>Manage plugins </strong>on the main menu, or after installing a plugin and clicking<strong> Continue</strong>, you can turn on or off plugins.
</p>
<p>A green thumbs up icon indicates that the plugin is enabled (on) and a red thumbs down icon indicated that the plugin is disabled (off).
</p>
<p> To disable (turn off) a plugin click on the green thumbs up.
  <br/></p>
<p><img src="static/turn_plugin_off.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>This will now turn red: the plugin is now disabled.
  <br/></p>
<p><img src="static/plugin_off.png" alt=""/><br/></p>
<p>&#160;
</p>
<h2>Deleting plugins
</h2>
<p>If you delete a plugin, you will loose any any settings or data related to that plugin. If you are not sure, it is better to disable rather than delete.
</p>
<p>If you are sure you want to delete a plugin, click the delete icon on the plugins page.
</p>
<p><img src="static/delete_1.png" alt=""/><br/></p><span class="listingname">
<p>Then click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.
</p>
<p><img src="static/confirm.png" alt=""/><br/></p></span></body></html>
