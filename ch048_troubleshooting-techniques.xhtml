</h1>
<p>This chapter gives you some hints on how to troubleshoot a problem with phpList.&#160;
</p>
<h2> Where to go first
</h2>
<p>The first place to go for help is <a href="http://community.phplist.com/users">community.phplist.com/users</a>&#160; - this page has the most up-to-date list of support resources and will guide you through the process of getting help step-by-step.
</p>
<h2>Describing your problem
</h2>
<p>One of the biggest barriers to problem solving is being able to describe the problem clearly and in enough detail. There is a useful article <a href="http://community.phplist.com/how-to-get-help-on-the-forums/">here</a> to help you with that - it's especially worth a read if you are "not very technical"
</p>
<h2>If you have an error message
</h2>
<p>If you have an error message, try pasting it into a search engine. All our forums and documentation are fully indexed by search engines, your solution might pop up in the results.
</p>
<h2>Don't give up!
</h2>
<p> If you have a problem that is hard to solve, it could be a "bug." In this case, take a look at the bug reporting process described on the community site - our developers team may be able to fix your problem in the next version.
